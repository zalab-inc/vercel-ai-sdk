# `MistralStream`

<Note type="warning">MistralStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  MistralStream is part of the legacy Mistral integration. It is not compatible
  with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK Mistral
  Provider](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/mistral) instead.
</Note>

Transforms the output from Mistral's language models into a ReadableStream.

This works with the official Mistral API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.
