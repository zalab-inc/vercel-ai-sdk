# `AnthropicStream`

<Note type="warning">AnthropicStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  AnthropicStream is part of the legacy Anthropic integration. It is not
  compatible with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK
  Anthropic Provider](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic) instead.
</Note>

It is a utility function that transforms the output from Anthropic's SDK into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Anthropic's response data structure.
