# `InkeepStream`

<Note type="warning">InkeepStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  InkeepStream is part of the legacy Inkeep integration. It is not compatible
  with the AI SDK 3.1 functions.
</Note>

The InkeepStream function is a utility that transforms the output from [Inkeep](https://inkeep.com)'s API into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Inkeep's response data structure.

This works with the official Inkeep API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.
