# `CohereStream`

<Note type="warning">CohereStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  CohereStream is part of the legacy Cohere integration. It is not compatible
  with the AI SDK 3.1 functions.
</Note>

The CohereStream function is a utility that transforms the output from Cohere's API into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Cohere's response data structure. This works with the official Cohere API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.
