# Streamable UI Component Error

## Issue

- Variable Not Found
- Cannot find `div`
- `Component` refers to a value, but is being used as a type

## Solution

If you encounter these errors when working with streamable UIs within server actions, it is likely because the file ends in `.ts` instead of `.tsx`.
